# ðŸ’Š Sentiment Analysis & Auto-Replier for Drug Reviews

An end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze patient-written drug reviews and automatically respond to negative feedback using a sentiment-aware chatbot. This project combines lexicon-based and transformer-based models with aspect-level sentiment detection to improve pharmaceutical feedback interpretation and engagement.

## ðŸ§ª Core Features

-   **Data Fusion:** Integrated ~10,000 reviews from WebMD with 5,000+ labeled UCI entries.
-   **NLP Preprocessing:** Lemmatization, stopword removal, regex cleaning, and POS-based filtering.
-   **Sentiment Modeling:** Multi-tier system: VADER â†’ SVM â†’ Voting Classifier â†’ DistilBERT (fine-tuned).
-   **Visual Analytics:** WordClouds, Heatmaps, Pie Charts, Radar Charts, and Treemaps.
-   **Aspect-Based Analysis:** Using SpaCy to extract noun phrases (e.g., "side effects") and correlate them with sentiment.
-   **Smart Auto-Replier Chatbot:** Generates human-like replies for negative/neutral reviews.

## ðŸ“Š Visual Analytics & Insights

The analysis begins with an overview of the dataset, identifying the most frequently discussed drugs and the overall sentiment distribution.

## ðŸ§  Model Performance

A multi-model strategy was employed, starting with a baseline SVM and progressing to a more advanced Voting Classifier. The confusion matrices below show their performance in classifying sentiment.

-   **SVM (TF-IDF):** 80% accuracy
-   **Voting Classifier:** 82% accuracy
-   **DistilBERT (fine-tuned):** 87% accuracy
-   **Aspect Extraction Accuracy:** 90% (manual validation)
